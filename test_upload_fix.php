echo "=== Upload Fix Test ===\n\n";

echo "🔍 **ANALYSIS FROM LOGS**:\n\n";

echo "✅ **What's Working**:\n";
echo "- File upload is successful\n";
echo "- File validation passes\n";
echo "- Laravel Excel import runs\n";
echo "- File is stored and processed\n\n";

echo "❌ **The Problem**:\n";
echo "- Database constraint error: trainer_id cannot be null\n";
echo "- The CSV doesn't have instructor data\n";
echo "- No default trainer is assigned\n\n";

echo "🔧 **The Fix Applied**:\n";
echo "1. Added default trainer assignment\n";
echo "2. If no instructor in CSV, use first available trainer\n";
echo "3. Added proper error handling for missing trainers\n\n";

echo "📋 **Test Steps**:\n";
echo "1. Go to: http://localhost:8008/admin/schedules/import\n";
echo "2. Upload: test_schedules_laravel_excel.csv\n";
echo "3. Check if schedules are created successfully\n";
echo "4. Look for success message\n\n";

echo "📊 **Expected Results**:\n";
echo "- 5 schedules should be imported\n";
echo "- 0 skipped (if trainers exist)\n";
echo "- Success message should appear\n";
echo "- Redirect to schedules list\n\n";

echo "🚨 **If Still Fails**:\n";
echo "- Check if any trainers exist in the database\n";
echo "- Look for new error messages in logs\n";
echo "- Verify the CSV format is correct\n\n";

echo "✅ **Success Indicators**:\n";
echo "- No more 'trainer_id null' errors in logs\n";
echo "- Schedules appear in the admin list\n";
echo "- Success message shows imported count\n\n";
