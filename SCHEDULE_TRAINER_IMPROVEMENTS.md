## Service Layer

### TrainerAvailabilityService

4. Updates schedule with new trainer

### Availability Checking
1. Enter schedule dates and times
2. System checks all trainer availability
3. Shows available/unavailable trainers
4. Provides detailed conflict information

## Benefits

### For Administrators
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Support for multiple trainers per schedule
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: No manual intervention needed when trainers are unavailable
- **Better Planning**: Clear visibility of trainer availability
- **Reduced Conflicts**: Intelligent conflict detection and resolution

### For Trainers
- **Clear Assignments**: Know when they're primary vs backup
- **Availability Management**: Easy to see their schedule conflicts
- **Group Collaboration**: Support for team teaching

### For Users
- **Reliable Classes**: Automatic backup ensures classes continue
- **Better Experience**: No last-minute cancellations due to trainer unavailability

## Technical Implementation

### Database Relationships
```sql
-- Many-to-many relationship
schedules <-> schedule_trainer <-> trainers

-- Backward compatibility
schedules.trainer_id (legacy)
schedules.primary_trainer_id (new)
```

### Availability Logic
1. Check trainer is active
2. Check trainer's default availability settings
3. Check for specific unavailabilities
4. Check for scheduling conflicts
5. Return availability status with reasons

### Priority System
1. Primary trainers (priority 1)
2. Backup trainers (priority 2, 3, etc.)
3. Any available trainer (fallback)

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing schedules continue to work
- Legacy `trainer_id` field maintained
- New `primary_trainer_id` field added
- Gradual migration to new system

### Data Migration
- Existing trainer assignments preserved
- New many-to-many relationships created
- No data loss during migration

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Advanced Availability Rules**: More sophisticated availability logic
2. **Trainer Preferences**: Allow trainers to set preferences
3. **Automated Scheduling**: AI-powered schedule optimization
4. **Mobile Interface**: Enhanced mobile trainer selection
5. **Analytics**: Trainer utilization and performance metrics

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Calendar Integration**: Sync with external calendars
2. **Notification System**: Automated notifications for availability changes
3. **Reporting**: Detailed trainer assignment reports
4. **API Extensions**: RESTful API for external integrations
