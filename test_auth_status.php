echo "=== Authentication Status Test ===\n\n";

echo "🔐 ADMIN ROUTES REQUIRE:\n";
echo "   - Authentication (logged in user)\n";
echo "   - 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)\n";
echo "   - Admin role\n\n";

echo "2. If you have 2FA enabled:\n";
echo "   - You'll be prompted for 2FA code\n";
echo "   - Enter the code from your authenticator app\n\n";

echo "3. Then access the import form:\n";
echo "   - Go to: http://localhost:8008/admin/schedules/import\n";
echo "   - You should see the import form (not a redirect)\n\n";

echo "🚨 COMMON AUTHENTICATION ISSUES:\n\n";

echo "❌ If you get redirected to login:\n";
echo "   - You're not logged in\n";
echo "   - Solution: Log in first\n\n";

echo "❌ If you get redirected to 2FA:\n";
echo "   - You need to complete 2FA\n";
echo "   - Solution: Enter your 2FA code\n\n";

echo "❌ If you get 'Access Denied':\n";
echo "   - You don't have admin role\n";
echo "   - Solution: Check your user role\n\n";

echo "✅ If the import form loads:\n";
echo "   - You're properly authenticated\n";
echo "   - You can proceed with CSV upload\n\n";

echo "🔧 TESTING STEPS:\n\n";

echo "1. Open browser and go to: http://localhost:8008/login\n";
echo "2. Log in with admin credentials\n";
echo "3. Complete 2FA if prompted\n";
echo "4. Go to: http://localhost:8008/admin/schedules/import\n";
echo "5. You should see the import form\n";
echo "6. Upload the test_schedules_import.csv file\n";
echo "7. Follow the import process\n\n";

echo "📞 TROUBLESHOOTING:\n\n";

echo "If you can't log in:\n";
echo "   - Check if the database has admin users\n";
echo "   - Try creating a new admin user\n";
echo "   - Check if 2FA is properly configured\n\n";

echo "If you get the 'GET method not supported' error:\n";
echo "   - You're trying to access the wrong URL\n";
echo "   - Use the import form, not the parse URL directly\n\n";
