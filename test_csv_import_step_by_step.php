echo "🚨 IMPORTANT: You cannot access the parse route directly!\n";
echo "The parse route only accepts POST requests with file uploads.\n\n";

echo "✅ CORRECT WORKFLOW:\n\n";

echo "Step 1: Access the Import Form\n";
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8008/admin/schedules/import\n";
echo "   Method: GET\n";
echo "   Status: ✅ This should work (requires admin login)\n\n";

echo "Step 2: Upload CSV File\n";
echo "   - Use the form on the import page\n";
echo "   - Select the test_schedules_import.csv file\n";
echo "   - Check 'First row contains headers'\n";
echo "   - Click 'Upload and Preview'\n";
echo "   - This makes a POST request to /admin/schedules/import/parse\n\n";

echo "Step 3: Map Columns\n";
echo "   - Review the parsed data\n";
echo "   - Map CSV columns to database fields\n";
echo "   - Click 'Import Schedules'\n";
echo "   - This makes a POST request to /admin/schedules/import/process\n\n";

echo "❌ WHAT YOU'RE DOING WRONG:\n";
echo "   - Trying to access http://localhost:8008/admin/schedules/import/parse directly\n";
echo "   - This route only accepts POST requests with file uploads\n";
echo "   - You cannot access it with a GET request\n\n";

echo "🔧 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n";

echo "1. Make sure you're logged in as an admin user\n";
echo "2. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8008/admin/schedules/import\n";
echo "3. If you get redirected to login, log in first\n";
echo "4. You should see the import form with instructions\n";
echo "5. Download the CSV template to see the format\n";
echo "6. Use the test_schedules_import.csv file we created\n";
echo "7. Upload the file through the form (not by accessing the parse URL directly)\n\n";

echo "📁 Test File Details:\n";
$testFile = 'test_schedules_import.csv';
if (file_exists($testFile)) {
    echo "   ✅ Test file exists: {$testFile}\n";
    echo "   📊 File size: " . filesize($testFile) . " bytes\n";
    echo "   📋 Contains: 5 test schedules\n";
} else {
    echo "   ❌ Test file missing: {$testFile}\n";
}

echo "\n🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:\n";
echo "   - Import form loads correctly\n";
echo "   - File upload works\n";
echo "   - Column mapping interface appears\n";
echo "   - Data validation works\n";
echo "   - Import completes successfully\n\n";

echo "🚨 COMMON MISTAKES:\n";
echo "   ❌ Don't try to access /admin/schedules/import/parse directly\n";
echo "   ❌ Don't use GET requests for file upload routes\n";
echo "   ✅ Always use the import form to upload files\n";
echo "   ✅ Follow the multi-step process\n\n";

echo "📞 If you're still having issues:\n";
echo "   1. Check if you're logged in as admin\n";
echo "   2. Make sure the server is running on port 8008\n";
echo "   3. Verify the test CSV file exists\n";
echo "   4. Follow the exact workflow above\n\n";
