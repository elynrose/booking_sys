/**
 * Upload Working Test
 * This script tests if the upload functionality is working
 */

echo "=== Upload Working Test ===\n\n";

echo "🔍 **DIAGNOSIS**: The upload might be working but you're not seeing the results!\n\n";

echo "📋 **What to check**:\n\n";

echo "1. **Check if the form is actually submitting**:\n";
echo "   - Open browser developer tools (F12)\n";
echo "   - Go to Network tab\n";
echo "   - Try uploading a file\n";
echo "   - Look for a POST request to /admin/schedules/import/process\n";
echo "   - Check if the request is successful (200 status)\n\n";

echo "2. **Check Laravel logs**:\n";
echo "   - Run: tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log\n";
echo "   - Try uploading again\n";
echo "   - Look for the log messages we added\n\n";

echo "3. **Check if schedules were actually created**:\n";
echo "   - Go to: http://localhost:8008/admin/schedules\n";
echo "   - Look for new schedules in the list\n\n";

echo "4. **Check for validation errors**:\n";
echo "   - The form might be showing errors but they're not visible\n";
echo "   - Check the page source for error messages\n\n";

echo "5. **Test with a simpler file**:\n";
echo "   - Try uploading the test file: test_schedules_laravel_excel.csv\n";
echo "   - This file should work with the current import system\n\n";

echo "🔧 **Quick fixes to try**:\n\n";

echo "1. **Clear Laravel cache**:\n";
echo "   php artisan cache:clear\n";
echo "   php artisan config:clear\n";
echo "   php artisan view:clear\n\n";

echo "2. **Check file permissions**:\n";
echo "   chmod -R 755 storage/\n";
echo "   chmod -R 755 bootstrap/cache/\n\n";

echo "3. **Test the route directly**:\n";
echo "   - The route should be: POST /admin/schedules/import/process\n";
echo "   - Make sure you're logged in as admin\n";
echo "   - Make sure 2FA is disabled (we did this earlier)\n\n";

echo "4. **Check browser console**:\n";
echo "   - Look for JavaScript errors\n";
echo "   - Check if the form is actually submitting\n\n";

echo "📊 **Expected behavior**:\n";
echo "- After successful upload, you should be redirected to /admin/schedules\n";
echo "- You should see a success message\n";
echo "- New schedules should appear in the list\n\n";

echo "🚨 **If nothing happens**:\n";
echo "- The form might not be submitting\n";
echo "- There might be a JavaScript error\n";
echo "- The server might be returning an error\n";
echo "- Check the Laravel logs for details\n\n";

echo "✅ **If it's working but no feedback**:\n";
echo "- The import might be working but the redirect is failing\n";
echo "- Check if you're being redirected to the right page\n";
echo "- Look for success messages in the session\n\n";
